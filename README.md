# Agentic Design Patterns

A comprehensive collection of design patterns for building AI agent systems. This repository demonstrates various architectural approaches for creating intelligent agents that can work individually or collaboratively to solve complex problems.

## What is an Agentic Design Pattern?

Agentic design patterns are architectural blueprints that define how AI agents can be structured, coordinated, and orchestrated to accomplish tasks effectively. These patterns provide proven approaches for building robust, scalable, and maintainable AI systems.

## Design Patterns Overview

### 1. [Prompt Chaining](./01.%20prompt_chaining/)
**Sequential Processing Pattern**

Connects multiple prompts in a sequence where the output of one prompt becomes the input to the next. This pattern is ideal for breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and ensuring logical flow of information processing.

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-step data transformation
- Complex reasoning tasks requiring sequential logic
- Content generation with refinement stages

---

### 2. [Routing](./02.%20routing/)
**Conditional Logic Pattern**

Directs user queries or tasks to specialized agents based on content analysis, keywords, or classification. This pattern enables intelligent task distribution and ensures queries are handled by the most appropriate agent.

**Use Cases:**
- Customer service chatbots with specialized departments
- Content classification and routing systems
- Multi-domain question answering systems

---

### 3. [Parallelization](./03.%20parallelization/)
**Concurrent Processing Pattern**

Executes multiple agents simultaneously to work on different aspects of a problem or completely separate tasks. Results can be processed independently or merged for comprehensive solutions.

**Use Cases:**
- Research gathering from multiple sources
- Parallel data processing tasks
- Independent analysis requiring multiple perspectives

---

### 4. [Reflection](./04.%20reflection/)
**Self-Improvement Pattern**

Implements self-evaluation and iterative improvement mechanisms where agents review their own outputs, identify issues, and refine their responses through multiple iterations.

**Use Cases:**
- Content quality assurance
- Code review and debugging
- Creative writing with self-editing

---

### 5. [Tool Use](./05.%20tool_use/)
**External Integration Pattern**

Equips agents with external tools and APIs to extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Agents can interact with databases, APIs, calculators, and other external services.

**Use Cases:**
- Mathematical computations
- Database queries and data retrieval
- Integration with external services and APIs
- Code execution and testing

---

### 6. [Planning](./06.%20planning/)
**Strategic Decomposition Pattern**

Breaks down complex objectives into actionable plans before execution. Agents first create detailed plans, then execute them step-by-step, enabling better organization and goal achievement.

**Use Cases:**
- Project management and task breakdown
- Complex problem solving requiring strategic thinking
- Multi-step process automation

---

### 7. [Multi-Agent Collaboration](./07.%20multi_agent_collaboration/)
**Collaborative Intelligence Pattern**

Orchestrates multiple specialized agents working together through various collaboration patterns including sequential handoffs, parallel processing, debate and consensus, hierarchical structures, expert teams, and critic-reviewer dynamics.

**Use Cases:**
- Complex multi-domain problems
- Collaborative decision making
- Large-scale content creation with multiple perspectives
- Quality assurance through peer review

---

### 8. [Memory Management](./08.%20memory_management/)
**Persistent Context Pattern**

Implements both short-term and long-term memory systems for agents to maintain context, learn from interactions, and provide personalized experiences across sessions. Combines temporary conversational memory with persistent knowledge storage.

**Use Cases:**
- Personalized AI assistants that remember user preferences
- Conversational agents maintaining context across long interactions
- Learning systems that improve based on historical interactions
- Knowledge accumulation for specialized domain expertise

---

### 9. [Learning and Adaptation](./09.%20learning_and_adaptation/)
**Continuous Improvement Pattern**

Enables agents to evolve beyond predefined parameters by learning from experience and environmental interaction. Agents improve autonomously through various learning mechanisms including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and direct preference optimization, allowing them to handle novel situations and optimize performance without constant manual intervention.

**Use Cases:**
- Reinforcement learning for autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments
- Few-shot learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal examples
- Online learning for real-time adaptation in streaming data scenarios
- Preference learning for aligning agent behavior with human values and expectations

---

## Implementation Technologies

Each pattern is implemented using popular AI frameworks and libraries:

- **LangChain**: For building chains and complex workflows
- **CrewAI**: For multi-agent orchestration and collaboration
- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**: For advanced agent development
- **Google Gemini**: As the underlying LLM for agent intelligence

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Pattern**: Navigate to any pattern directory to explore specific implementations
2. **Review Requirements**: Check the `requirement.txt` in each folder for dependencies
3. **Set Up Environment**: Configure your API keys (typically `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
4. **Run Examples**: Execute the provided Python scripts to see patterns in action
